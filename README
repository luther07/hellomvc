Hello World for PHP/Zend/MVC framework

This 'hello world' app was influenced by the zend "quickstart" tutorial and "Zend Framework in Action".

Project configuration
* install Zend framework (package names maybe zendframework, zendframework-bin)
* configure include_path variable by your chosen method (I edited my php.ini)
* "zf create project projectname", execute this command in the location where you want to build your project
* "cd projectname"
* "zf enable layout"
* edit application/configs/application.ini, [production] section, adding: "resources.view[] ="
* edit application/Bootstrap.php, adding protected function _initDoctype() like this:
{ $this->bootstrap('view');
  $view = $this-getResource('view');
  $view->doctype('XHTML1_STRICT');
}
* edit application/views/scripts/index/index.phtml, creating well-formed HTML (XHTML), which includes:
<title> <?php echo $this->escape($this->title);?> </title>
<body> <h1> <?php echo $this->escape($this->title);?> </h1> </body>

Apache2 configuration
* create virtual host file as /etc/apache2/sites-available, with variable ServerName projectname.local 
* edit /etc/hosts, adding line like:   127.0.0.X	projectname.local
* enable site with command: a2ensite hellomvc
* reload apache2 config with command: /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Point your web browser to projectname.local, or whatever entry you put into /etc/hosts
